# secure_user_autentication
 Project: Secure Authentication System
This is a modern web-based authentication system built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
It provides:

✅ User Login & Registration
✅ Password strength indicator
✅ Password match validation
✅ Smooth UI animations and transitions
✅ Basic client-side user management with local storage
✅ A simple protected dashboard after login
✅ Demo profile avatar and account info display

Note: This is a demo system for learning purposes — it does not use a real backend or secure password hashing. For production, use a server-side solution with encrypted databases and secure hashing algorithms like bcrypt.
